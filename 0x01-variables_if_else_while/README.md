## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), <b>without the help of Google:</b>


### General

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- How to use the while loop
- How to use variables with the while loop
- How to print variables using printf
- What is the ASCII character set
- What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64


## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
